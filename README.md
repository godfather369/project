#Image Carousel

This project is about creating an image carousel. It starts working automatically, when the page is opened.

There are three parts in this project - Image Carousel, Digital Timer and Analog Timer. Each of them contains a reset buttuon. And all the reset buttons are in sync i.e. if any of the reset buttons is pressed, all the parts are reset. The default time interval is 10 seconds. After every time interval, the degital timer, the analog timer will reset to their respective initial positions, and a new image will be displayed in the Image Carousel.

There is one more feature in the header section which contains an input bar and a start button. Input bar can take time input from the user and the start button will assign the input as the new time interval for digital timer,  analog timer and image carousel. All the reset buttons will still be functioning.
